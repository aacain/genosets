Ticket numbers refer to issues at http://code.google.com/p/parsets/issues/list

V2.1, 2009-08-03
	* Add menu
	* Add screenshot function (issue #9)
	* Add way to reinitialize database
	* Add option to make highlighted ribbons/bars stand out more (issue #6)
	* Add way of sorting categories in a dimension by name or size (issue #8)
	* Show what's new in version check dialog
	* Fix a number of bugs in the data import that lead to wrong values.
	  We suggest you re-import data sets to be sure they have been correctly
	  parsed.
	* Fix some bugs related to parsing that could crash the importer
	* Change the data model so it no longer depends on the potential number
	  of category combinations, but only the actual number of combinations.
	  This pushes the data set size and number of dimensions that can be
	  imported beyond most real data sets.
	* Fix a bug that resulted in crashes if there was a duplicate column name
	  in the data, or it was created by the program when converting the names
	  (issue #12)
	* Fix problem when column name starts with a digit, which causes a parse
	  error in SQL (issue #13)

V2.0, 2009-06-01
	* Original release
