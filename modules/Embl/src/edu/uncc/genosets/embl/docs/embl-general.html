<h1>Loading EMBL Annotations</h1>
<hr />
<p>GenoSets provides several ways to load annotations from EMBL files.</p>
<h2>Load by selecting from a list of completed EMBL projects</h2>
<p>Annotation files can be selected from a list of completed EMBL projects.&nbsp; 
GenoSets queries the EMBL database to find all completed projects and the user 
may select multiple files from a last for loading.&nbsp; The files are 
automatically downloaded and stored in the GenoSets database.</p>

Important</strong><br />
Only chromosome files are included in the list of completed EMBL projects.&nbsp; 
Plasmid and contig files must use an alternate method to load into GenoSets.</p>
<h2>Load by Accession Id</h2>
<p>Files may be downloaded from EMBL and loaded into GenoSets by providing an 
INSD accession number. The accession id may contain a range which is useful for 
downloading contig sets.&nbsp; Additionally, multiple accessions may be loaded 
simultaneously by entering the accession ids separated by line, tab, column, or 
semicolon.&nbsp; A single accession id may also include the version 
number (&lt;accession&gt;.&lt;version&gt;).&nbsp; The latest version will be loaded if no 
version number is specified.&nbsp; If a range is specified, the sequence version 
will be ignored and the latest version will be loaded.</p>
<p>Example: To download all the contig files for<em> Brucella abortus</em> NCTC 
8038, specify the accession range of ACJJ01000001-ACJJ01000045.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Example: To download plasmid pYJ016 for <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> YJ016, 
specify accession AP005352.</p>
<h2>Annotation Method</h2>
<p>A annotation method is created for each accession id.&nbsp; The method name 
is the accession id and the method version is in the format 
&lt;accession&gt;.&lt;version&gt; of the file.&nbsp; You do not need to set these in the 
wizard.</p>
