        <h2>Running OrthoMCL</h2>
    	<p>GenoSets helps to create all the files necessary to run OrthoMCL on a 
		given set of genes.</p>
		<p>To create a new OrthoMCL download set:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open the Download window.<br></li>
			<li>Create a new Download set of type Annotations.<br></li>
			<li>Add all of the annotation files to include in the run of 
			OrthoMCL. You can do this by dragging annotation files from the 
			Project window into the download set.<br></li>
			<li>Right-click the File Formats Node and select New File Type.<br>
			</li>
			<li>Select OrthoMCL as the new file type to start the OrthoMCL 
			wizard.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Wizard Settings:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><A HREF="#pathVariables">Path Variables:</a><p>The path variables must be set for the perl 
			bin folder, the orthoMCL bin folder, and the MCL bin folder. The 
			script file can be created local but run on a different machine. 
			Make sure the path variables are for the machine that is to run the 
			script.</p>
			<p>If the location of perl is /usr/bin/perl,&nbsp; then the perl bin 
			should be set to:</p>
			<p>&nbsp;/usr/bin/</p>
			<p>If the OrthoMCL script orthomclInstallSchema (along with the 
			other orthomcl files) is located at 
			/usr/orthomcl/bin/orthomclInstallSchema, the the orthomcl bin should 
			be set to:</p>
			<p>/usr/orthomcl/bin/</p>
			<p>If MCL is located at /usr/bin/mcl, the the MCL bin path should be 
			set to:</p>
			<p>/usr/bin/</p>
			</li>
			<li>BLAST Settings:<p>The settings for the BLAST run can be set in 
			the BLAST Settings wizard step. The output format must be set to 
			tab-delimeted (-outfmt 6 for NCBI BLAST) and the name of the BLAST 
			output file should be blast.out.<br></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Database Settings:<p>OrthoMCL requires an instance of Mysql or 
			Oracle. The database user must have adequate priveleges. See 
			OrthoMCL documentation for more information.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>OrthoMCL Setting:<p>The OrthoMCL settings can be set in the 
			final step of the wizard. For more information on OrthoMCL settings 
			see OrthoMCL documentation.<br>Selecting Finish will add the 
			download format to the download set. The files will not be 
			downloaded until the user selects download from the context menu 
			that is available from right-clicking the download set.When 
			downloaded a number of files will be saved on the local machine 
			including a folder named fasta that contains all the fasta files, a 
			config_file, and a script file (runOrthomcl.sh or runOrthomcl.bat).</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
