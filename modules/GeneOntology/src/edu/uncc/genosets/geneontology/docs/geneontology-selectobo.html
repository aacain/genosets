<h2>Selecting a Gene Ontology Mapping File</h2>
<p>The selected obo file is very important in loading files.&nbsp; You should 
select the most recent full obo file.&nbsp; It is important that all possible 
terms exist within the obo mapping file.&nbsp; If the term is not found in the 
mapping file, an error may occur.&nbsp; The only time the obo mapping file does 
not need not need to include all of the terms is when a view is being filtered.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you use FULL/gene_ontology_edit.obolatest.&nbsp; This 
file is downloaded from <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/ontology/">
www.geneontology.org/ontology/</a>.</p>
